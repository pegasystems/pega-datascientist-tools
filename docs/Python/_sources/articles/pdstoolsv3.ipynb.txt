                "With the version 3 release of pdstools, the back-end of the libary has shifted to use [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars). Polars is a blazingly fast DataFrames library implemented in Rust using Apache Arrow Columnar Format as the memory model. This means faster analyses and a more robust API: both externally and internally within our library. However, it is not a minor change, and will change the way you interact with the library. This article goes over some of the most notable changes, and most importantly: best practices.\n",

This allows you to iteratively build up your query, have Polars optimise it for you, and only `collect` the data after your entire query. In practice, this means that all row-wise filters & column-wise selects are shifted right to whenever you read the file, and all computations are optimised further. Let's look at an example, and one close to home!\n",
