# Contribution Guide
We love feedback and contributions. Thank you for helping improve Pega Data Scientist Tools!

## Getting Help
- **Bugs / Feature Requests:** Open an [Issue](https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-datascientist-tools/issues).
- **Questions / Discussions:** Use the [Discussions](https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-datascientist-tools/discussions) tab.


## Contributing workflow
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork.
3. Create a new branch for your change (`git checkout -b amazing-feature`).
4. Commit your work with clear messages (`git commit -m 'Added an amazing feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin amazing-feature`)
6. Open a Pull Request (PR).


## Testing
Pull requests trigger continuous integration via [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). These workflows automatically run tests and check on your changes. You can also enable Actions in your fork to test before submitting. To manually and locally run the tests with pytest, use either your IDE or the command line:

```bash
pytest python/tests
```

## Documentation and articles
- The Python documentation uses Sphinx to generate the docs, nbsphinx to convert the jupyter notebooks to markdown, and Furo as the Sphinx template. These dependencies can be installed (from python/docs) with pip install -r docs-requirements.txt. Pandoc is a requirement too and needs to be installed separately.
- A Makefile is provided to create the documentation. The docs are automatically generated on any push commits in the master branch, but you can build them locally by following the :

### Create documentation locally 
To generate a new version of the docs, simply navigate to the top-level folder and run the following command:
```sh
cd python/docs && make html
```

### Edit or Add new content
To edit or add content, make changes / new files in the examples folder. The articles should be jupyter notebook files, and **should be empty, not pre-run**.

1. Create an article somewhere in the top-level `examples` folder. These articles should be jupyter notebook files, and should be **empty, not pre-run**.
2. Edit the cp command in `python/docs/Makefile` where the articles are copied to a temporary to include your article.
3. Update `python/docs/source/index.rst` and add your entry to the included notebooks. Since they will be moved to the `articles` folder, simply enter the name of the notebook file, without extension.
4. Be aware that the H1 headers of your notebook will be used as the entries in the doc index. If you have multiple H1's, you get multiple entries.

For example, if we added an article called `Example.ipynb` in the `examples/helloworld` folder, we would add `../../examples/helloworld/Example.ipynb` to the cp line in the Makefile (right before `source/articles`, of course), and add `articles/Example` to the `python/docs/source/index.rst` file. To test that it works, we recommend building the docs (`make html`) locally before creating a pull request.
