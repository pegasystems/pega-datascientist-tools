## Predictor contributions at model level
The top-{TOP_N} predictors over the entire model, selected by their absolute average contribution to predictions

```{{python}}
from pdstools.explanations import Explanations

explanations = Explanations(root_dir="{ROOT_DIR}")
explanations.aggregate.data_folderpath = "{DATA_FOLDER}"
overall_plot, predictor_plots = explanations.plot.plot_contributions_for_overall(
    top_n={TOP_N}, 
    top_k={TOP_K}
)
overall_plot.show()
```

## Predictor value contributions at model level
The predictor value contributions for the top-{TOP_N} predictors. Similar to above, the predictor values are selected by their absolute average contribution to predictions.

```{{python}}

from IPython.display import display, Markdown
for plot in predictor_plots:
    title = plot.layout['title']['text']
    plot.layout['title']['text'] = ''
    display(Markdown(f'### {{title}}'), plot)
