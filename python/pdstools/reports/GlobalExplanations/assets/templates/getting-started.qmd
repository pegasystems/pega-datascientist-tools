## Introduction

This report contains a break down of the {CONTRIBUTION_TEXT} for each predictor made to model predictions. The report is generated over the aggregated explanations data {DATE_INFO}.

### Model Overview

The model overview page shows `top-{TOP_N}` predictors that, on average, had the heighest contribution to the model predictions.
In addition to the {CONTRIBUTION_TEXT} for those `top-{TOP_N}` predictors, the overview page also shows the {CONTRIBUTION_TEXT} for each predictor values. For symbolic predictors, the `top-{TOP_K}` predictor values are shown. For numeric predictors, the predictor values are binned according to the contribution deciles. The model overview will be generated over all model contexts.

### By model context

The **By Model Context** section displays the same information as in the model overview section, but for explanations aggregated within a specific model context. So instead of showing the {CONTRIBUTION_TEXT} of predictors, you can see the {CONTRIBUTION_TEXT} of predictors for a given a pyName, pyOutcome, pyIssue, etc. 

*Note*: The model context plots are generated for the `top-{MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMIT}` model contexts sorted by frequency of samples.
