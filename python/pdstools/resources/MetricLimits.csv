DecisionHealth,InboundNoActionRatio,,0,0.1,0.8,Ratios are 0-1 percentages are 0-100%. Mark suggests to reverse the metric so higher numbers are generally better.,For numeric values:
DecisionHealth,InboundOptionality,2,7,,,"Green colored metrics currently available, black not (yet)",Good values (green) are between Best Practice Min and Max (INCLUSIVE the min/max values)
DecisionHealth,OutboundNoActionRatio,,0,0.3,0.8,Can be higher than inbound,Values below Minimum or above Maximum will be colored RED (if Min/Max are defined).
DecisionHealth,OutboundOptionality,2,7,,,,Values between Minimum and Best Practice Min or between Best Practice Max and Maximum become AMBER.

Environment,IsPegaCloud,TRUE,,,,,For logical values:
ML Models,ActivePredictorsPerModelAverage,2,5,100,,Per configuration?,Use either Best Practice Min or Max (or both) to give the GOOD value (which becomes green)
