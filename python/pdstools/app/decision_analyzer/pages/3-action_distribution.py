# TODO the stages need to be much more dynamic, driven from the data and potentially be many - see latest mocks Dennis as well in GOAL-25903
# TODO given there can be many stages, we should perhaps see about selecting multiple, coordinate w Dennis on this but only if we have such data
# TODO consider a top K argument again, to limit the bars, also consider the plotly option to always show all ticks, easily misleading otherwise (or show somewhere that there are more)
# TODO consider a plot of how often "winning", at rank x, or is this simply the final stage

# Distribution of the Actions

This is simply showing the overall distribution of the actions at the selected stage. This can help
answering questions like:

* What are the most common offers? In which issues/groups?

* What are the most common offers for a certain group of issues, within a certain channel etc - by applying filters first, or using
the graph controls directly.

* Does the distribution look okay?
