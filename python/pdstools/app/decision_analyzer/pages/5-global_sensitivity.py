Showing the *overall* effect of propensity, value, levers and context weights
on the decisions made.

Sensitivity is defined as the number of winning actions that change when
omitting just this one arbitration factor. The percentages indicates how
many of the total (final) decisions would change. The percentages will
usually not add up to 100%.
