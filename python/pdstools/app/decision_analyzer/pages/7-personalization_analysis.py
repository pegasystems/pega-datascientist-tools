Analysis of the number of actions per customer. Do we have enough options for people? Global filters can
be applied like everywhere to look at e.g. a certain group of issues.

As and when we have more different stages in the data, these analyses
will automatically support those.

The propensity pre-arbitration is not available in the actual Decision Analyser data as this is only calculated
in the Arbitration stage for the actions prioritized by AI.
