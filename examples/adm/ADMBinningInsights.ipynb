For example showing that \"People with income > 60000 and age > 30\" are more likely to respond positively to Cards offers.\n",

The bin counts are heavily dependent on channel both in absolute numbers as in the ratio between positives and negatives (success rate) so aggregating those does give meaningful results.

The second target bin falls completely within the range of bin 2 of the source, so gets the exact same lift value. Same for the target bins 3 and 4, they are both sourced from just source bin 3.
