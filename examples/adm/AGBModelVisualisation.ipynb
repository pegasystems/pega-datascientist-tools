    "With the introduction of ADM Gradient Boosting, we now support tree-based models in ADM as an alternative to the traditional Bayesian approach. In prediction studio, there is some information on the predictors, the model performance et cetera. However, it is also possible to export the trees themselves to analyze them further. This example demonstrates some of the info you can extract yourself, including a visualisation of the actual trees - which also allows you to check the exact 'path' a prediction used through each individual tree. \n",

    "On a gradient boosting model page in prediction studio, you can download an export of the model under the 'actions' button in the top right. We've also shipped an example file of a pre-built tree in the data folder, and a 'dataset' to automatically import it from the internet. That is what we will be using for this example.\n",
