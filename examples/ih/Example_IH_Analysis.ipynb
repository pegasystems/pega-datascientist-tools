    "# Example IH Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction History (IH) is a rich source of data at the level of individual interactions from Pega DSM applications like CDH. It contains the time of the interaction, the channel, the actions/treatments, the customer ID and is used to track different types of outcomes (decisions, sends, opens, clicks, etc). It does **not** contain details of individual customers - only their ID's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction History is typically used to analyze customer behavior and optimize decision strategies. The following sections provide various example analyses that can be performed on IH data, including distribution analysis, response analysis, success rates, model performance, propensity distribution, and response time analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most of PDSTools, it uses [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for visualization and [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/) (dataframe) but the purpose of this Notebook is more to serve example analyses than re-usable code, although of course we do try to provide some generic, re-usable functions. All of the analyses should be able to be replicated easily in other analytical BI environments - except perhaps the analysis of model performance / AUC.\n",
