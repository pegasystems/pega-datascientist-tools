# ADM Datamart Health Check

This document gives a generic and global overview of the Adaptive models 
and predictors. It is generated from an R notebook in the [Pega Data Scientist Tools](https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-datascientist-tools). That repository
of tools and scripts also contains a notebook to generate stand-alone
model reports for individual models, please refer 
to the [Wiki](https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-datascientist-tools/wiki).

This document provides a first-level scan of the models after which a 
deeper and more customer specific deeper dive can be done.

## Guidance

Where possible, we try to provide guidance and best practices in the form
of bulletted lists of attention points. However these are only generic 
practices and may or may not be applicable to the specific use case and 
situation of the implementation. 

## User experience

Some of the plots provide some interactivity. For best viewing results, open the 
HTML document in a browser. Viewing it from platforms like Sharepoint or 
Github will loose the interactive charts.

## Output format

Note that the notebook by default generates a single-page HTML, however you
can also export to PDF as well as other formats supported by Pandoc (e.g. Word) 
but you would loose interactivity.

configurationNamesInStandardNBADModelNames <- sapply(unique(datamart$modeldata$ConfigurationName), function(x) { x %in% standardNBADModelNames})
```

In a typical NBAD setup, channels are served by both one channel specific model configuration as well as a cross-channel *OmniAdaptiveModel* configuration. That *OmniAdaptiveModel* is typically used only as a fall-back option when the treatment model is not mature enough.

If a channel has two model configurations with a naming pattern like "Adm_12345678912", this could indicate the usage of
the (no longer recommended) "2-stage model" predictions for conversion modeling, generated by Prediction Studio.

The standard Pega Next Best Action Designer framework defines a number of standard
Adaptive Models for channels. By looking at the names of the configurations it seems
that the framework **`r ifelse(any(configurationNamesInStandardNBADModelNames), ifelse(all(configurationNamesInStandardNBADModelNames), "is being used", "is being used with additional configurations"), "is not being used")`**.

## Guidance

* Look out for channels supported by more than two model configurations, although
there may be valid reasons to do so (e.g. different sets of predictors for certain issues)
* Channels with no responses at all
* Channels with no positive feedback

```{r Channel overview}
channelSummary <- datamart$modeldata[, .(`Responses` = max(ResponseCount), 
                                         `Positives` = max(Positives), 
                                         `Base rate` = sprintf("%.2f%%", 100*max(Positives)/max(ResponseCount)),
                                         `Supported by Configurations` = paste(sort(unique(ConfigurationName)), collapse = ", "),
                                         N = uniqueN(ConfigurationName)), 
                                     by=c("Channel","Direction")][order(Channel)]

# Overview of the Actions

In a standard setup, the offers/conversations are presented as treatments for
actions in a hierarchical structure setup in NBA Designer. The recommendation
is to have multiple treatments for an action. Treatments are often channel
specific and you would typically expect more unique treatments than there
are actions.

Adaptive Models are created per treatment (at least in the default setup) and
the recommendation is to stick the default context keys of the models.

### Guidance

* Recommended best practice is to have multiple treatments for an action. Too few
gives less opportunity for personalization of the interactions.
* Pega Customer Decision Hub deployed in Pega Cloud has limits in place that constrain certain elements of the service and its use to ensure high quality of service for your team. Where
relevant, these limits are used in the guidance in this health check. See [Service and data health limits for Pega Customer Decision Hub on Pega Cloud](https://docs-previous.pega.com/pega-customer-decision-hub-user-guide/87/service-and-data-health-limits-pega-customer-decision-hub-pega-cloud).

## Success Rates per Channel

Showing the current success rate of the treatments. Different channels usually 
have very different success rates. Just showing the top `r params$max_propositions_in_plot`
here and limiting to the propositions that have received at least `r params$min_responses_to_show_propositions` responses (the rates reported by
the models are unreliable otherwise). 

### Guidance

* Look out for propositions that stand out, having a far higher success rate
than the rest. Check with business if that is expected. 

* Variation in the set of offered propositions across customers is also an important metric but not one that can be derived from the Adaptive Model data - this requires analysis of the actual interactions.

```{r Plot Action Success Rates}
if (nrow(filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata)[ResponseCount >= as.integer(params$min_responses_to_show_propositions)]) > 0) {
  p <- plotPropositionSuccessRates(datamart, 
                                   filter=function(mdls){ filterLatestSnapshotOnly(mdls)[ResponseCount >= as.integer(params$min_responses_to_show_propositions)] }, 
                                   limit=params$max_propositions_in_plot, 
                                   facets=c("Direction", "Channel")) + 
    scale_fill_continuous_divergingx()
} else {
  p <- plotPropositionSuccessRates(datamart, 
                                   filter=function(mdls){ filterLatestSnapshotOnly(mdls) }, 
                                   limit=params$max_propositions_in_plot, 
                                   facets=c("Direction", "Channel")) + 
    scale_fill_continuous_divergingx()
}

# ggplotly(p) %>% layout(showlegend=FALSE) # plotly no use here given the way the plot is constructed
p
```

## All Success Rates (interactive chart)

Interactive chart with all success rates. Whiter is lower success rates,
green is higher. Indicated values are percentages.

```{r Success rates interactive}
treeData <- aggregateTreeData(filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata))

fig <- plot_ly(
  type="treemap",
  ids=treeData$TreeNodeID,
  labels=treeData$TreeLabel,
  parents=treeData$TreeNodeParent,
  values=round(100*treeData$SuccessRate,3),
  marker=list(colorscale='Greens', reversescale = T),
  textinfo="label+value"
)
fig %>% layout(title = "Success Rate")
```

## Success Rates over Time

Showing how the overall channel success rates evolved over the time that the data
export covers. Split by Channel and model configuration. Usually there are separate model
configurations for different channels but sometimes there are also additional
model configurations for different outcomes (e.g. conversion) or different
customers (e.g. anonymous).

### Guidance

* There shouldn't be too sudden changes over time


```{r Success Rate over Time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!hasMultipleSnapshots(datamart$modeldata))
{
  cat("Trend plots will only be available when the model data contains multiple snapshots.", fill=T)
} else {
  if (max(datamart$modeldata$ResponseCount) < 100) {
    p <- plotSuccessRateOverTime(datamart, 
                                 aggregation = c("Channel"),
                                 facets = c("Direction", "ConfigurationName")) + 
      scale_color_Channel
  } else {
    p <- plotSuccessRateOverTime(datamart, 
                                 filter=function(mdls){ mdls[ResponseCount >= 100] }, 
                                 aggregation = c("Channel"),
                                 facets = c("Direction", "ConfigurationName")) + 
      scale_color_Channel
    #geom_smooth(aes(fill=Channel), alpha=0.1)
  }
  p
}
```

# Overview of Adaptive Models

There are a total of **`r nrow(filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata))` models**  in the latest snapshot.

The standard configuration is to have one model per treatment.

```{r Overview adaptive}
# Name and Treatment will be separate columns when read properly via ADMDatamart
groupingCols <- intersect(c("ConfigurationName", "Direction", "Channel"), names(datamart$modeldata))

actionsOverview <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata)[, .(Treatments = .N), 
                                                                by=c(groupingCols, "Name")]

actionsOverviewSummary <- actionsOverview[, .(`Standard in NBAD Framework` = first(ConfigurationName) %in% standardNBADModelNames,
                                              `Number of Actions` = .N, 
                                              `Number of Models` = sum(Treatments), 
                                              `Average number of Treatments per Action` = mean(Treatments)), 
                                          by=groupingCols][order(Direction, Channel, ConfigurationName)]

actionsOverviewSummary %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(4, background = ifelse(actionsOverviewSummary[[4]],"white", "orange")) %>%
  column_spec(7, background = ifelse(actionsOverviewSummary[[7]] >= 2,"white", "orange"))
```

## Model Performance

### Model Performance vs Action Success Rates (aka the Bubble Chart)

This "Bubble Chart" - similar to the standard plot in the ADM reports in Pega - 
shows the relation between model performance and proposition success rates. In 
addition, the size of the bubbles indicates the number of responses.

#### Guidance

* Bubbles stacked up against the left-hand vertical axis represent actions/treatments
for which the models are not predictive. These models may be still be ramping up, or
they may not have predictive enough features to work with: consider if new/better
predictors can be added. 

* Charts should not be empty or contain only a few bubbles. Such charts may 
represent channels or configurations not (or no longer).

* Bubbles at the bottom of the charts represent propositions with very low success rates - they may not be compelling 
enough. 

* In an ideal scenario you
will see the larger bubbles more on the top-right, so more volume for propositions
with higher success rates and better models.

* There should - roughly - be a positive correlation between success rate and performance per channel. 

* There should be a positive correlation between responses and performance - also per channel.

* There should be variation in response counts (not all dots of equal size)

* For small volumes of good models, see if the engagement rules in the Decision Strategy are overly restrictive or reconsider the arbitration of the propositions so they get more (or less)
exposure.

if (nrow(filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata)[ResponseCount >= 100]) > 0) {
  plt <- plotPerformanceSuccessRateBubbleChart(datamart, 
                                               filter=function(mdls){ filterLatestSnapshotOnly(mdls)[ResponseCount >= 100] },

                                               facets = c("ConfigurationName", "Direction", "Channel"))
}

### Model Performance over Time

Showing how the model performance evolves over time. Note that ADM is by 
default configured to track performance over all time. You can configure a
window for monitoring but this is not commonly done.

Aggregating up to Channel and splitting by model configuration.

#### Guidance

* No abrupt changes but gradual upward trend is good


```{r Performance over Time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!hasMultipleSnapshots(datamart$modeldata))
{
  cat("Trend plots will only be available when the model data contains multiple snapshots.", fill=T)
} else {
  p <- plotPerformanceOverTime(datamart, aggregation = "Channel", 
                               facets = c("Direction", "ConfigurationName")) +
    scale_color_Channel  
  #geom_smooth(aes(fill=Channel), alpha=0.1)
  p
  # ggplotly(p)
}
```

### Model performance of all the actions

Using an interactive treemap to visualize the performance. Lighter is better,
darker is low performance.

It can be interesting to see which issues, groups or channels can be better
predicted than others. Identifying categories of items for which the predictions
are poor can help to drive the search for better predictors, for example.


```{r Treemap action performance}
treeData <- aggregateTreeData(filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata))

fig <- plot_ly(
  type="treemap",
  ids=treeData$TreeNodeID,
  labels=treeData$TreeLabel,
  parents=treeData$TreeNodeParent,
  values=round(treeData$Performance,2),
  # see https://plotly.com/r/builtin-colorscales/
  # https://plotly.com/r/reference/#heatmap-colorscale
  # https://plotly.com/r/treemaps/
  # https://plotly.com/r/colorscales/
  marker=list(colorscale="Viridis", reversescale = F),
  textinfo="label+value"
)
fig %>% layout(title = "Model Performance")
```

## Response counts for all the actions

Using an interactive treemap to visualize the response counts. Darker is more.

Different channels will have very different numbers but within one channel the
relative differences in response counts give an indication how skewed the
distribution is.

### Guidance

* If there are actions that have a much higher response count than the rest see 
why that is. Possibly they are levered up for valid business reasons.


```{r Treemap response count}
fig <- plot_ly(
  type="treemap",
  ids=treeData$TreeNodeID,
  labels=treeData$TreeLabel,
  parents=treeData$TreeNodeParent,
  values=treeData$ResponseCount,
  # see https://plotly.com/r/builtin-colorscales/
  # https://plotly.com/r/reference/#heatmap-colorscale
  # https://plotly.com/r/treemaps/
  # https://plotly.com/r/colorscales/
  marker=list(colorscale="Viridis", reversescale = T),
  textinfo="label+value"
)
fig %>% layout(title = "Response Count")
```

# Analysis of Predictors

This analysis focuses on finding which are top predictors that are driving the models. 

The predictors are categorized (by color) by the "source". By default this takes
just the first part before the dot, so this typically distinguishes between
Customer, Account, IH and parameterized (Param.) predictors. You can customize
this to add patterns to identify for example external scores.

## Number of Predictors per model configuration

Both active and inactive predictors.

Note that the total number of predictors in the model data does not always equate
the data from the more detailed view split by category below.

```{r}
predictorsPerModelConfiguration <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata)[, .(Predictors = max(TotalPredictors), 
                                                 `Used In (Channels)` = paste(sort(unique(paste(Direction, Channel, sep="/"))), collapse=", "), 
                                                 `Used For (Issues)` = paste(sort(unique(Issue)), collapse=", ")), 
                                             by=c("ConfigurationName")][order(ConfigurationName)] 

if (all(is.na(predictorsPerModelConfiguration$Predictors)))
{
  cat("No predictor information present in the model data.", fill=T)
} else {
  predictorsPerModelConfiguration %>%
    kbl() %>%
    kable_paper(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F) %>%
    column_spec(2, background = ifelse(predictorsPerModelConfiguration[[2]] >= 200 & predictorsPerModelConfiguration[[2]] <= 700,"white", "orange"))
}
```

## Number of Predictors per Predictor Category

Split by category (defaults to the string before the first dot, can be overridden
when reading the data).

The numbers here can differ from the totals above, these ones are leading.

```{r Predictor Type Counts}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  combined <- merge(filterClassifierOnly(filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$predictordata), reverse = T), 
                    filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata)[, .N, by=c("ModelID", "ConfigurationName")], by="ModelID")
  counts <- combined[, .(N = uniqueN(PredictorName)), keyby=c("ConfigurationName", "PredictorCategory")]
  
  predictorTypeCounts <- dcast(counts, ConfigurationName ~ PredictorCategory, value.var="N", fill = 0)
  predictorTypeCounts[, Total := rowSums(.SD[,2:ncol(predictorTypeCounts)])]
  
  tbl <-  predictorTypeCounts %>%
    kbl() %>%
    kable_paper(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)

  if ("IH" %in% names(predictorTypeCounts)) {
    colIdx <- which(names(predictorTypeCounts) == "IH")[1]
    tbl <- tbl %>% column_spec(colIdx, background = ifelse(predictorTypeCounts[[colIdx]] <= 100,"white", "orange"))    
  }
  
  if ("Param" %in% names(predictorTypeCounts)) {
    colIdx <- which(names(predictorTypeCounts) == "Param")[1]
    tbl <- tbl %>% column_spec(colIdx, background = ifelse(predictorTypeCounts[[colIdx]] <= 24,"white", "orange"))    
  }
  
  tbl <- tbl %>% 
    column_spec(ncol(predictorTypeCounts), background = ifelse(predictorTypeCounts$Total >= 200 & predictorTypeCounts$Total <= 700,"white", "orange"))
  
  # for (i in 2:ncol(predictorTypeCounts)) {
  #   tbl <- tbl %>% column_spec(i, background = ifelse(predictorTypeCounts[[i]] >= 200 & predictorTypeCounts[[i]] <= 700,"white", "orange"))  
  # }
  
  tbl
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```

### Guidance

* Total number of predictors per model 200 - 700 to stay within service limits
* There should be some "IH" predictors but no more than ca 100 of them
* No more than a few dozen Param predictors
* Consistency in the numbers across configurations

## Predictor Importance across all models per configuration

Box plots of the predictor importance. Importance can be shown either as
a global feature importance or simply as the univariate predictor importance,
here we use univariate performance measured in AUC (Area under the ROC curve)
but the PDS tools functions also support using Feature Importance.

### Guidance

* You expect most predictors to have a spread in the performance range, doing better for some actions than for others
* Predictors only showing as a single bar (no range) are suspicious
* A variation of predictors from different categories in the top `r params$max_predictors_in_plot`
* A min/max of the univariate AUC performance somewhere between 55 and 75


```{r Univariate Predictors Boxplot}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  for (c in levels(datamart$modeldata$ConfigurationName)) {
    # applicableModels <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata) [ConfigurationName==c]
    # applicablePredictorBins <- modelPredictorBins[ModelID %in% applicableModels$ModelID & EntryType=="Active"]
    
    plt <- plotPredictorImportance(datamart,
                                   limit = params$max_predictors_in_plot, 
                                   showAsImportance = F,
                                   filter = function(mdls) {
                                     filterLatestSnapshotOnly(mdls) [ConfigurationName==c]
                                   })
    
    if (is.null(plt)) {
      warning("Empty plot for configuration", c)
    } else {
      plt <- plt + ggtitle("Predictor Performance", 
                           subtitle = paste0("(Top ", params$max_predictors_in_plot, " from ", uniqueN(filterClassifierOnly(datamart$predictordata[ModelID %in% unique(datamart$modeldata[ConfigurationName == c]$ModelID)], reverse=T)$PredictorName), " in ", c, ")")) +
        scale_fill_PredictorCategory
      print(plt)
      # ggplotly(plt)
    }
  }
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```


## Importance by Predictor Category

Aggregating up to the category of the predictors. This gives a view at
a glance of how well e.g. interaction history, external model scores or contextual data are doing overall.

### Predictor Category performance per Channel

```{r Univariate Predictor Category Boxplot}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  plt <- plotPredictorImportance(datamart,  
                                 categoryAggregateView = T,
                                 facets = c("ConfigurationName", "Direction", "Channel"),
                                 showAsImportance = F,
                                 filter = function(mdls) {filterLatestSnapshotOnly(mdls)} ) +
    scale_fill_PredictorCategory
  print(plt)
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```

### Relative Predictor Category importance per Configuration

Although the same could be achieved using the standard `plotPredictorImportance` 
method, now that we only split by Configuration this allows for a more compact visualization using
a stacked bar chart.

```{r Predictor categories by Config only, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  predCategoryOverview <- merge(filterActiveOnly(datamart$predictordata), 
                                unique(datamart$modeldata[,c("ModelID", "ConfigurationName")]), 
                                by="ModelID", all.x=F, all.y=F)[,.(Count = .N, Performance = sum(Performance-0.5)), by=c("PredictorCategory","ConfigurationName")]
  # weighted.mean(Performance,ResponseCount)
  plt <- ggplot(predCategoryOverview,
                aes(ConfigurationName, Performance, fill=PredictorCategory)) +
    geom_col(position = position_fill()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1)) +
    scale_fill_PredictorCategory +
    coord_flip() + theme(legend.position="top") +
    ggtitle("Contribution of different sources") +
    xlab("Model")
  
  ggplotly(plt)
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```


## Bad predictors across all models

See if there are predictors that are just always perform poorly.

### Guidance

* Predictors that consistently perform poorly could potentially be removed.
* Be sure to check for data problems
* Note we advise to be careful with predictor removal. Only remove if there is 
clearly no future value to other propositions as well or if there is always a 
related predictor that performs better.

### TODO different viz

* Provide as a (scrollable) list instead of plot (predictor, usage, performance range etc)


```{r Bad predictors}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  plt <- plotPredictorImportance(datamart, facets=NULL, 
                                 limit = -params$max_predictors_in_plot,
                                 showAsImportance = F,
                                 filter = function(mdls) {filterLatestSnapshotOnly(mdls)})
  
  plt <- plt + ggtitle("Predictors with Low Performance", 
                       subtitle = paste0("(Bottom ", params$max_predictors_in_plot, " from total ", uniqueN(filterClassifierOnly(datamart$predictordata, reverse=T)$PredictorName), ")")) +
    scale_fill_PredictorCategory
  print(plt)
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```

## Number of Active and Inactive Predictors

Showing the number of active and inactive predictors per model.

### Guidance

* We expect a few dozen active predictors for every model instance

```{r Active and Inactive Predictors, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  typeDistributionPlotData <- 
    merge(unique(filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$predictordata)[EntryType!="Classifier", 
                                                                  c("ModelID", "PredictorName", "EntryType", "Type")]) [, .N, by=c("EntryType", "Type", "ModelID")], 
          unique(filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata)[, c("ModelID", "ConfigurationName")]), by="ModelID")
  
  # add entries for counts of numeric and symbolic together
  typeDistributionPlotData <- rbindlist(list(typeDistributionPlotData, typeDistributionPlotData[,.(N = sum(N)), by=c("ModelID", "ConfigurationName", "EntryType")][, Type := "overall"]), use.names = T)
  
  plt <-
    ggplot(typeDistributionPlotData, aes(N, Type, color=Type, linetype=EntryType)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_color_discrete_qualitative(name="Predictor Type") +
    scale_linetype_discrete(name="Status") +
    ylab("")+ xlab("") + 
    facet_wrap(. ~ ConfigurationName, strip.position = "right") +
    # theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
    ggtitle("Number of Predictors per Model", subtitle = "by Type, Status and per model configuration")
  
  plt
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```


## Predictor Performance across Propositions

A view of predictor performance across all propositions, ordered so that the best performing predictors are at the top and the 
best performing propositions are on the left. Green indicates good performance, red means more problematic - either too low or too good to be true.

```{r Predictors vs Propositions}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  for (c in levels(datamart$modeldata$ConfigurationName)) {
    # applicableModels <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(mdls) [ConfigurationName==c]
    # applicablePredictorBins <- modelPredictorBins[EntryType=="Active" & ModelID %in% applicableModels$ModelID]
    datamart$predictordata[, ResponseCount := as.numeric(ResponseCount)] # temp hack
    plt <- plotPredictorImportanceHeatmap(datamart, 
                                          limit=params$max_propositions_in_plot,
                                          filter = function(mdls) {
                                            filterLatestSnapshotOnly(mdls) [ConfigurationName==c]
                                          } ) +
      theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=8),
            axis.text.x = element_text(size=8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),
            strip.text = element_text(size=8))
    if (is.null(plt)) {
      warning("Empty plot for configuration", c)
    } else {
      print(plt)
    }
  }
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```

## Missing values

If a predictor is low performing: are there too many missing values? This could point to a technical problem

Missing % is number of missing vs all responses, really just a filter on model data

This (currently) only shows the fields that have any missing values

```{r missing values}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  missingData <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$predictordata) [, .(ResponseCount = max(as.numeric(ResponseCount)), 
                                                                       Missing = max(c(0,BinResponseCount[BinType=="MISSING"]))), 
                                                                   by=c("PredictorName", "PredictorCategory", "ModelID", "Type")]
  
  missingData[, MissingPct := Missing/ResponseCount]
  missingData <- merge(missingData, unique(datamart$modeldata[, c("ModelID", "ConfigurationName")]))
  
  head(missingData)
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```


```{r Treemap missing values}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  hierarchy <- c("ConfigurationName", "PredictorCategory", "PredictorName")
  mainLabel <- "Missing data in Adaptive Models"
  
  missingDataTree <- rbindlist(lapply(seq(length(hierarchy)), function(i) {
    missingData[, .(ResponseCount = sum(ResponseCount),
                    Missing = sum(Missing),
                    MissingPct = sum(Missing) / sum(ResponseCount),
                    TreeNodeID = paste(lapply(.BY, as.character), collapse="/"),
                    TreeLabel = as.character(lapply(.BY, as.character)[i]),
                    TreeNodeParent = ifelse(i==1, mainLabel, paste(lapply(.BY, as.character)[1:(i-1)], collapse="/"))), 
                by=eval(hierarchy[1:i])]  
  }), fill = T)
  
  
  fig <- plot_ly(
    type="treemap",
    ids=missingDataTree$TreeNodeID,
    labels=missingDataTree$TreeLabel,
    parents=missingDataTree$TreeNodeParent,
    values=ifelse(is.na(missingDataTree$MissingPct), 0, round(missingDataTree$MissingPct*100,2)),
    marker=list(colorscale='YlOrRd', reversescale = T),
    textinfo="label+value"
  )
  fig # %>% layout(uniformtext=list(minsize=6, mode='hide'))
} else {
  cat("Predictor analysis not available.", fill=T)
}
```

# Responses

In the sections below we check which of these models have reached certain
reliability (or "maturity") thresholds. This is based on heuristics on both
the number of positives (> `r params$min_positives_for_maturity` considered mature) and performance.

## Empty and Immature Models

### Guidance

All below lists are guidance. There should be just a small percentage of
immature or empty models overall.
Having no or just 1 active predictor is very suspicious

```{r CategorizeModels}
models4MaturityChecks <- copy(datamart$modeldata)

models4MaturityChecks[, isEmpty := ResponseCount == 0]
models4MaturityChecks[, noPositives := ResponseCount > 0 & Positives == 0]
models4MaturityChecks[, isImmature := Positives > 0 & Positives < as.integer(params$min_positives_for_maturity)]
models4MaturityChecks[, noPerformance := Positives >= as.integer(params$min_positives_for_maturity) & Performance == 0.5]

availableStandardContextKeys <- intersect(c("ConfigurationName", "Issue","Group","Name","Channel","Direction","Treatment"), names(models4MaturityChecks))
fieldsForModelAnalysis <- c(availableStandardContextKeys, c("ResponseCount", "Positives", "Negatives", "Performance"))

setorderv(models4MaturityChecks, availableStandardContextKeys)

modelsNeverUsed <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(models4MaturityChecks)[(isEmpty), fieldsForModelAnalysis, with=F]
modelsNoPositives <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(models4MaturityChecks)[(noPositives), fieldsForModelAnalysis, with=F]
modelsImmature <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(models4MaturityChecks)[(isImmature), fieldsForModelAnalysis, with=F]
modelsNoPerformance <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(models4MaturityChecks)[(noPerformance), fieldsForModelAnalysis, with=F]
```

### Models that have never been used

These models have no responses at all: no positives but also no negatives. The
models for these actions/treatments exist, so they must have been created
in the evaluation of the actions/treatments, but they were never selected
to show to the customer, so never received any responses.

Often these represent actions that never made it into production and were
only used to test out logic. But it could also be that the response mechanism
is broken. It could for example be caused by outcome labels that are returned by the channel application not matching the configuration of the adaptive models.

#### TODO: consider creating an Excel file with these and all subsequent lists

Showing first `r min(nrow(modelsNeverUsed), params$max_models_in_list)` from total of `r nrow(modelsNeverUsed)`.

```{r Never used models}
modelsNeverUsed %>% 
  head(params$max_models_in_list) %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

### Models that have have been used but never received a positive response

These models have been used but never received a "positive" response. This means
the action/treatments that these models represent have been selected, so an
"impression" has been made to the customer, but they never received a "positive"
response.

This could be because no customer found the proposition attractive, but it could
also be because the response loop is not working correctly. Possibly Pega "believes" the user received the action but the actual channel application did never show
it.

Showing first `r min(nrow(modelsNoPositives), params$max_models_in_list)` from total of `r nrow(modelsNoPositives)`.

```{r No positives models}
modelsNoPositives %>% 
  head(params$max_models_in_list) %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px")
```


### Models that are still in an immature phase of learning

These models have received at least one positive response but not enough yet to
be qualified to be fully "mature" - a concept that matters especially for 
outbound channels.

These actions are typically new and still in early phases of learning.

We show the "reach" of these actions as the percentage of the population that
would be selected by the standard maturity capping algorithm in the NBA
framework (which selects 2% for new models and 100% for models with `r params$min_positives_for_maturity` or 
more positive responses).

Showing first `r min(nrow(modelsImmature), params$max_models_in_list)` from total of `r nrow(modelsImmature)`.

```{r Immature models}
modelsImmature[, -"ResponseCount"][, Reach := sprintf("%.2f%%", 100.0*(0.02+0.98*pmin(as.integer(params$min_positives_for_maturity), Positives)/as.integer(params$min_positives_for_maturity)))] %>% 
  head(params$max_models_in_list) %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = T) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px")
```


### Models that have received sufficient responses but are still at their minimum performance

These models also have received over `r params$min_positives_for_maturity` positives but still show the minimum
model performance. 

This could be an indication of data problems, or not having the
right predictors but may also be caused by technical aspects like the order of
the responses to the model.

Showing first `r min(nrow(modelsNoPerformance), params$max_models_in_list)` from total of `r nrow(modelsNoPerformance)`.

```{r No performance models}
modelsNoPerformance %>% 
  head(params$max_models_in_list) %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px")

### Number of Empty/Immature Models over time

In the analysis below we count the number of models in each of the groups analysed before and show how that count changes over time. The expectation is that the number of "non-empty" models increases steadily and the other lines are more or less stable.

Empty is defined as having
no responses at all. Immature is defined as having < `r params$min_positives_for_maturity` positives, and no
performance means model performance is still the initial 0.5 value while having
matured already according to the definition.

### Guidance

* Empty models shouldnt be increasing too much
* Good models (AUC 55-80) should increase or at least not decrease
* Good models should be much higher than problem kids


```{r Number of Empty or Immature models over time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!hasMultipleSnapshots(datamart$modeldata))
{
  cat("Trend plots will only be available when the model data contains multiple snapshots.", fill=T)
} else {
  
  immatureModelsByChannel <- models4MaturityChecks[, list(`Empty Models` = length(unique(ModelID[(isEmpty)])), 
                                                          `Models w/o Positives` = length(unique(ModelID[(noPositives)])), 
                                                          `Immature Models` = length(unique(ModelID[(isImmature)])), 
                                                          `Models w/o Performance` = length(unique(ModelID[(noPerformance)])),
                                                          `Number of non-empty Models` = length(unique(ModelID[(!isEmpty)]))), 
                                                   by=c("Direction", "Channel", "SnapshotTime")]
  
  ggplot(melt(immatureModelsByChannel, c("Direction", "Channel", "SnapshotTime"), 
              variable.name="Count", value.name="N"),

}
```

## Number of Responses over time

Showing the response rate over time. You would expect this to be more or 
less constant, only changing if there is a sudden change in targeted population.

Big spikes and very noisy behavior may be caused by changes in the setup.

```{r Responses over time}
datamart$modeldata[["SnapshotTimeDay"]] <- ceiling_date(datamart$modeldata$SnapshotTime, unit="days")

responseRates <- datamart$modeldata[, .(ResponseCount = sum(ResponseCount)), 
                                    by=c("SnapshotTimeDay", "Direction", "Channel", "ConfigurationName")][order(SnapshotTimeDay)]

responseRates[, PrevResponseCount := shift(ResponseCount), by=c("Channel", "ConfigurationName")]
responseRates[, DeltaResponseCount := ResponseCount - PrevResponseCount]
responseRates[, ResponseRate := DeltaResponseCount/(24*60)] # per minute

if (uniqueN(responseRates$SnapshotTimeDay) <= 1)
{
  cat("Response rate analysis only available when there are multiple days of snapshots.", fill=T)
} else if (nrow(responseRates[!is.na(ResponseRate) & (ResponseRate > 0)]) == 0) {
  cat("No changes in response counts in provided data.", fill=T)  
} else {
  ggplot(responseRates[!is.na(ResponseRate) & (ResponseRate > 0)], aes(SnapshotTimeDay, ResponseRate, colour=Channel)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_color_Channel +
    facet_wrap(. ~ Direction+ConfigurationName, scales="free_y") +
    ggtitle("Responses per minute") +
    xlab("Date") + ylab("Response Rate")
}
```



# Which Models drive most of the Volume

## Analysis of skewness of the Responses

Showing the cumulative response count vs the number of models. Is there a 
larger percentage of models that take the vast majority of the responses?

If this line strongly deviates from the diagonal it means that relatively few
models drive the majority of the responses.

In the left-hand plot we look at all responses, which really means that we are looking
at "impressions" mostly. The right-hand plot looks at just the positives. Typically,
the positives are driven more strongly by the models so often you see more
skewness in that one.

However very skewed results may be caused by prioritization elements like 
levers and weights and can be a reason to check in with business and verify that
this is expected.

### Guidance

* Area under this curve should be > 0.5 and perhaps more towards 1 - most
of the responses driven by relatively few actions


```{r Response gain chart, fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
responseGainData <- 
  filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata) [, list(Responses = max(as.double(ResponseCount)), Positives = max(Positives)), 
                                                by=c("Channel", "ModelID")]
responseGainData <- rbindlist(list(copy(responseGainData)[, Label := "All responses"],
                                   copy(responseGainData)[, Label := "Just the Positive responses"]))


setorder(responseGainData, Channel, -Responses)
responseGainData[Label == "All responses", TotalResponseFraction := cumsum(Responses) / sum(Responses) , by=Channel]
responseGainData[Label == "All responses", TotalModelsFraction := seq(.N)/.N , by=Channel]
setorder(responseGainData, Channel, -Positives)
responseGainData[Label == "Just the Positive responses", TotalResponseFraction := cumsum(Positives) / sum(Positives) , by=Channel]
responseGainData[Label == "Just the Positive responses", TotalModelsFraction := seq(.N)/.N , by=Channel]

# make it start at 0,0
responseGainData <- rbindlist(list(responseGainData, 
                                   responseGainData[, list(TotalResponseFraction = 0, TotalModelsFraction = 0, Responses = 0, Positives = 0), 
                                                    by=c("Channel", "ModelID", "Label")]), use.names = T)

plt <- ggplot(responseGainData, aes(TotalModelsFraction, TotalResponseFraction, color=Channel)) + 
  geom_line(size=1) +
  scale_color_Channel +
  scale_x_continuous(name="Percentage of Models", labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Percentage of Responses", labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,1)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Label) +
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color="grey", linetype="dashed") +
  ggtitle("Cumulative Responses by Models", subtitle = "by Channel")

ggplotly(plt)
```



## Models with largest number of responses (positive or negative).

Zooming in into the models that drive most of the responses, here we list the 
top `r params$max_propositions_in_plot` models with the highest number of responses.

### Guidance

* There shouldn't be very large outliers

```{r Models with top responses, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
topNResponses <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata) [frank(-ResponseCount, ties.method="dense") <= params$max_propositions_in_plot][order(-ResponseCount)]
topNResponses[, Label := apply(topNResponses[,availableStandardContextKeys,with=F], 1, paste, collapse="/")]
topNResponses[, Rank := factor(seq(.N), levels=rev(seq(.N)))]

ggplot(topNResponses,
       aes(Rank, ResponseCount, fill=Channel)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(y=0,label=Label), size=3, hjust=0) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_Channel +
  ggtitle(paste("Top", params$max_propositions_in_plot, "highest Responses"))
```

## Models with largest number of positive responses.

And these are the `r params$max_propositions_in_plot` models with the largest
number of positives.

```{r Models with top positives, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
topNPositives <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata) [frank(-Positives, ties.method="dense") <= params$max_propositions_in_plot][order(-Positives)]
topNPositives[, Label := apply(topNPositives[,availableStandardContextKeys,with=F], 1, paste, collapse="/")]
topNPositives[, Rank := factor(seq(.N), levels=rev(seq(.N)))]

ggplot(topNPositives,
       aes(Rank, Positives, fill=Channel)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(y=0,label=Label), size=3, hjust=0) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_Channel +
  ggtitle(paste("Top", params$max_propositions_in_plot, "highest Positives"))
```




## Analysis of Performance vs Volume

Is most volume driven by models that have a good predictive performance? Ideally
yes, so the targeting of the customers is optimal. If a lot of volume is driven
by models that are not very predictive, this could be a reason to look into
the available predictor data.

The plot below shows this relation. Horizontally the model performance (the
AUC, ranging from 50 to 100 as Pega usually scales this), descretized into a 
number of ranges, and vertically the percentage of responses.

A lot of volume on the first bins, where the performance is minimal, means
that a lot of immature models are used. This is sub-optimal in terms of 
targeting. Ideally there is a smooth curve with a peak in the 60-80 range
of AUC. Much higher AUC's are possibly indicative of immature models or even
outcome leakers (although that is effectively prevented by the standard
delayed learning pattern). AUC's below 60 are not uncommon but should be 
investigated - consider different predictors or outcomes.

```{r AUC vs Volume gains, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cumAUCOverVolumeData <- 
  filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata) [, list(Performance = 100*max(Performance), 
                                                       ResponseCount = max(as.double(ResponseCount))), 
                                                by=c("Direction", "Channel", "ModelID")]
cumAUCOverVolumeData[, TotalResponses := sum(ResponseCount), by=Channel]
cumAUCOverVolumeData[, PerformanceBin := cut(Performance, breaks=15)]

plt <- ggplot(cumAUCOverVolumeData[, list(N = sum(ResponseCount)/TotalResponses), 
                                   by=c("PerformanceBin", "Direction", "Channel")], 
              aes(PerformanceBin, N, color=Channel)) + 
  #geom_col(position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group=Channel), se = F, method = "loess") +
  scale_color_Channel +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Percentage of Responses", labels = scales::percent) +
  xlab("Model Performance") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1)) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ Direction) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Volume vs Model Performance", subtitle = "by Channel")

ggplotly(plt)
```

## Positives vs. Number of Models

Ideally, all models have received plenty of responses which will make them
"mature" and makes sure they are as predictive as possible.

Often we see that there is a significant percentage of models that are still
relatively new and have not received much feedback (yet). Below graph shows
the percentages of models that have fewer than `r params$min_positives_for_maturity` positives.

Having many on the left-hand side (with very low or perhaps no positives) may
or not be a problem. The models may still be there in the datamart but might
represent actions/treatments that are not active.

```{r Postives gains, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, message=FALSE}
modelsByPositives <- filterLatestSnapshotOnly(datamart$modeldata)
modelsByPositives[, PositivesBin := cut(Positives, breaks=c(seq(0,as.integer(params$min_positives_for_maturity),by=10), Inf), 
                                        right=F)]
modelsByPositives <- modelsByPositives[, list(Positives = min(Positives), 
                                              Models = uniqueN(ModelID)),
                                       by=c("Direction", "Channel", "PositivesBin")]
setorder(modelsByPositives, Positives)
modelsByPositives[, cumModels := Models/sum(Models), by=c("Direction", "Channel")]

plt <- ggplot(modelsByPositives, aes(PositivesBin, cumModels, color=Channel)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group=Channel), size=1) + geom_point() +
  scale_color_Channel +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Percentage of Models", labels = scales::percent) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1)) +
  xlab("Positives") +
  facet_wrap(. ~ Direction) +
  ggtitle("Percentage of models vs number of positive responses", subtitle = "by Channel")

ggplotly(plt)
```


# Propensity Analysis

The distribution of propensities returned by the models is yet a different angle.

Higher propensities clearly indicate the offers are more attractive - people
apparenty click/accept/convert more often.

## Success Rate distribution

```{r Success Rate distribution, fig.height=5}

channelz <- as.character((datamart$modeldata[Performance > 0.5,.N,by=Channel])[N>0]$Channel)

sampledRates <- datamart$modeldata[ResponseCount > 0, .(SuccessRate = sample(SuccessRate, prob=ResponseCount, size=10000, replace=T)), 
                                   by=c("Direction", "Channel", "ConfigurationName")]
quantiles <- sampledRates[, .(p5 = quantile(SuccessRate, 0.05)), by=c("Channel", "Direction", "ConfigurationName")]

plt <- ggplot(datamart$modeldata, aes(SuccessRate, color=ConfigurationName)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(.~Channel+Direction) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Success Rates", subtitle = "dashed line is 5th quantile") + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  geom_vline(data=quantiles, aes(xintercept=p5, color=ConfigurationName), linetype="dashed")
print(plt)    
    
plt <- ggplot(sampledRates, aes(SuccessRate, color=ConfigurationName)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(.~Channel+Direction) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Sampled Success Rates", subtitle = "taking number of responses into account") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  geom_vline(data=quantiles, aes(xintercept=p5, color=ConfigurationName), linetype="dashed")
print(plt)
```

## Propensity distribution from Binning

In a more emphathetic setup, you would expect that the distribution of the 
propensities leans towards the right-hand side: more volume to more attractive 
offers, although the relation is of course more complex, we are not just blindly pushing the offers with the
highest success rates, but take a personalized approach.

Often however, multiple factors are included in the prioritization, changing this
picture.

Note that the propensity bins are not of equal width. Propensities are typically
very low so with an equal width distribution, almost all volume would be in the
first bins. The binning here is based on (roughly) equal volume across all data.

So when one of the graphs shows more volume on the left, that is to be 
interpreted as relative to the other graphs.

```{r Propensity distribution, fig.height=3, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  classifiers <- merge(filterClassifierOnly(datamart$predictordata), 
                       unique(datamart$modeldata[,c("ModelID", "Direction", "Channel")]), by="ModelID")
  # classifiers[, Propensity := (0.5+BinPositives)/(1+BinResponseCount)]
  classifiers[, PropensityRange := Hmisc::cut2(Propensity, g=15)]
  classifiers[, TotalVolume := sum(BinResponseCount), by=c("Direction", "Channel")]
  
  setorder(classifiers, Direction, Channel, PropensityRange)
  
  propensityDistributionData <- classifiers[,list(RelVolume = sum(BinResponseCount)/TotalVolume, 
                                                  BinVolume = sum(BinResponseCount),
                                                  Propensity = max(Propensity)), 
                                            by=c("Direction", "Channel", "PropensityRange", "TotalVolume")]
  propensityDistributionData[, CumVolume := cumsum(BinVolume), by=c("Direction", "Channel")]
  propensityDistributionData[, CumFraction := 1 - CumVolume/TotalVolume]
  
  ggplot(propensityDistributionData,
         aes(PropensityRange, RelVolume, fill=Channel, group=Channel)) +
    geom_col() + geom_smooth(se=F, method = "loess") +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1, size=7)) +
    facet_wrap(. ~ Channel, strip.position = "right") + #, scales = "free_x") +
    xlab("Propensity") +
    scale_y_continuous(name="Volume", labels = scales::percent) +
    scale_fill_Channel + 
    facet_wrap(. ~ Direction) +
    ggtitle("Volume vs. Propensity") 
} else {
  cat("Propensity analysis will only be available when predictor binning data is available.", fill=T)
}
```

## Propensity thresholding

If you would apply a threshold on the propensities, in the plot below you see
the portion of the customers that you would reach based on the propensities
from the models.

Note that in CDH, prioritization typically includes value and often also 
weights and levers that are not taken into account in this view.

```{r Cumulative Propensity distribution, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!is.null(datamart$predictordata) && nrow(datamart$predictordata) > 0) {
  
  plt <- ggplot(propensityDistributionData, aes(Propensity, CumFraction)) +
    geom_line(aes(color=Channel, group=Channel), size=1) +
    scale_color_Channel +
    scale_y_continuous(name="Fraction of Customers", labels = scales::percent) +
    facet_wrap(. ~ Direction) +
    ggtitle("Cumulative Volume reached by thresholding on Propensity") +
    xlab("Propensity Threshold")
  
  ggplotly(plt)
} else {
  cat("Propensity analysis will only be available when predictor binning data is available.", fill=T)
}
```


# Appendix - all the models

```{r List all models}
datamart$modeldata[, list(Snapshots = .N, Responses = max(as.double(ResponseCount))), by=c(availableStandardContextKeys, "ModelID")] #[order(ConfigurationName, Name)]
```

A list of all the models is written to a file `r params$modellist` so a script
can iterate over all models and generate off-line model reports for each of 
them.

Generally you will want to apply some filtering, or do this for specific models
only. This can be accomplished in either this script here, or by editing the
generated file.

```{r File with all models}
if (params$modellist != "") {
  inclKeys <- availableStandardContextKeys[sapply(availableStandardContextKeys, 
                                                  function(x) {
                                                    return(length(unique(datamart$modeldata[[x]]))>1)
                                                  })]
  
  modelIDandSanitizedNames <- unique(datamart$modeldata[, list(make.names(apply(.SD, 1,
                                                                                function(x) {
                                                                                  return(paste(x,collapse="_"))
                                                                                }))), 
                                                        by=ModelID, .SDcols=inclKeys])
  
  write.table(modelIDandSanitizedNames[ModelID %in% unique(datamart$predictordata$ModelID)], 
              params$modellist, row.names = F, col.names = F, quote=F, sep=";")
}
```
