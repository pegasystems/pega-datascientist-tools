    "# Global Explanations for Adaptive Gradient Boosting Models\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "__2025-10-17__\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to analyze and visualize global explanations for Adaptive Gradient Boosting models in Pega Adaptive Decision Manager (ADM). Global explanations provide insights into which predictors have the most influence on model predictions and how different predictor values correlate with the model's scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The SHAP explanation datasets used in this notebook are available starting with **Pega Infinity '25**. In earlier versions, the explanation files are not written to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanation files contain SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) contributions for a sample of model executions. This notebook shows how these contributions are aggregated to provide global explanations for Gradient Boosting models. In Pega Infinity '25, a Global Explanations report can also be generated directly from [Prediction Studio](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/platform/page/platform/decision-management/gradient-boosting-explanations.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on earlier versions:** In versions prior to Infinity '25, Feature Importance (also known as Predictor Importance) is already available for Gradient Boosting models and uses SHAP values. In Infinity '25, we enhance this by providing detailed insights into the correlation between predictor _values_ and the model's score (for example, high income may correlate with a high contribution to the propensity score for a platinum credit card offer) rather than just the importances of predictors. See: https://docs.pega.com/bundle/platform/page/platform/decision-management/view-summarized-reports-adm.html\n"
